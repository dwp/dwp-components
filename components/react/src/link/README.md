# Links

Links are blue and underlined by default. If your link is at the end of a sentence or paragraph, make sure that the linked text doesnâ€™t include the full stop.

Use the `muted` property where it is not helpful to distinguish between visited and unvisited states, for example when linking to pages with frequently-changing content such as the dashboard for an admin interface.
