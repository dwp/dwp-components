# Buttons

## When to use this component
Use the button component to help users carry out an action on a GOV.UK page like starting an application or saving their progress.

## How it works
Write button text in sentence case, describing the action it performs. For example ‘Save and continue’ or ‘Start now’.

### Disabled buttons
Disabled buttons have poor contrast and can confuse some users, so avoid them if possible.

Only use disabled buttons if research shows it makes the user interface easier to understand.

### Start buttons
Use a start button as the main call to action on your service’s start page.
