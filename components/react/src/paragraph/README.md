# Paragraph

The default paragraph (`<Paragraph.M/>`) font size is 19px on large screens and 16px on small screens.

You can take advantage of different paragraph sizes (`<Paragraph.#/>`) to create larger or smaller text in your page.

## Lead paragraph

A lead paragraph (`<Paragraph.L/>`) is an introductory paragraph that you can use at the top of a page to summarise the content. Lead paragraphs use 24px type on desktop and **should only be used once per page if needed**.
