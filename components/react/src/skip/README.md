# Skip Link

Use the skip link component to help keyboard-only users skip to a particular focus within another component.

## When to use this component
All GOV.UK pages must include a skip link in the header.

## How it works
Some people use the tab key on their keyboard to navigate through the links and form elements on a web page.

Including the skip link component gives users the option to bypass the top-level navigation links and jump to the main content on a page.

The skip link component is visually hidden until a keyboard press activates it.
