# Back Links

Use the back link component to help users go back to the previous page in a multi-page transaction.

## When to use this component

You can include a back link on other pages within a multi-page transaction, if it makes sense to do so.

## When not to use this component

Don’t use the back link component together with breadcrumbs. If necessary, you should do research with your users to learn which they find more helpful in your service.

## How it works
Back links must always go at the top of a page.

Make sure the link takes users to the previous page.
