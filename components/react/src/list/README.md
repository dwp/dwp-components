# Lists
Use lists to make blocks of text easier to read, and to break information into manageable chunks.

## Bulleted lists
Introduce bulleted lists with a lead-in line ending in a colon. Start each item with a lowercase letter, and don’t use a full stop at the end.

## Numbered lists
Use numbered lists instead of bulleted lists when the order of the items is relevant.

You don’t need to use a lead-in line for numbered lists. Items in a numbered list should end in a full stop because each should be a complete sentence.
